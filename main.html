                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is noyeal joseph, and I am excited to share my journey as I pursue a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in artificial intelligence and data science. My passion for technology and problem-solving has driven me to explore the dynamic world of engineering. With a keen interest in AT, I am eager to gain the skills and knowledge needed to innovate and create solutions that make a difference.<br>

                    Throughout my academic journey, I have engaged in various projects and activities that have deepened my understanding of internet of things(IOT). I believe that the collaborative and hands-on nature of a B.Tech program will provide me with the practical experience and critical thinking skills essential for success in this field.<br>
                    
                    I am looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals, learning from experienced mentors, and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of technology. This pursuit is not just about acquiring a degree for me; itâ€™s about building a foundation for a career where I can contribute to meaningful advancements in our world.<br>
